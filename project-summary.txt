Project Title: Shopify AI Chatbot (n8n + GPT + Webhook)

Summary:
This automation project simulates a Shopify customer support chatbot using n8n. The chatbot can handle multiple intents such as order status inquiries, FAQs, help requests, and support contact—based on the user's message.

Tools Used:
- n8n (self-hosted)
- OpenRouter GPT API (Mistral model)
- Postman (for testing)
- JSON-based Webhook input

Features:
✔️ Smart intent detection (order, faq, help, support)
✔️ Mock Shopify order data injected dynamically
✔️ GPT-generated replies (custom per intent)
✔️ Clean response returned via webhook
✔️ All nodes renamed for client clarity

Tested using Postman with 4 unique messages:
1. “Where is my order?” → GPT reply using mock data
2. “Do you offer free shipping?” → FAQ reply
3. “I need help.” → Help intent reply
4. “I want to talk to support.” → Contact info reply

This workflow is modular and can be extended to real Shopify API, or connected to other chat platforms.
